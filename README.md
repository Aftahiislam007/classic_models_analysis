## Overview

- The dataset contains data on customers, employees, offices, products, product order details, and customer product payments.
- Here, I calculate the total sales of products that were ordered by the customers.
-  The profit margin value is calculated by the summation of product profits, and the total percentage of profit margin is calculated by analyzing the total profit and sales value of products.
-  Customers inspect the most ordered product to reveal the top-selling product.
-  The amount of sales increased in 2004 rather than the year 2003 based on months.
-  The sum of a product quantity is shown based on order year and product line, and also the sum of sales is shown by analyzing the product line.
